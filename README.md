# Books Gallery

# About The Project

This website-based books gallery application was built to make it easier for people who like to read to make it easier to access books, because the system is online, where we don't have to go to a bookstore.

# Build With

1. Next JS
   Next js is used to build the view that the user will see. I use Next JS because it makes the routing feature easier, and the optimization is very fast.

2. Firebase
   Firebase is used for the login feature with the oauth 2.0 system with Google integration. I use firebase because it is very simple in application development.

3. REST API (Google Books API)
   REST API is used to connect my app and fetch data of whole books from Google Books API service.

4. Redux Toolkit
   Redux Toolkit is used to manage state transfers that occur in my application. I use the Redux toolkit because it is very easy to manage because it doesn't need too complicated configuration.

5. Javascript
   Javascript is used as the programming language for this application.

6. daisy UI
   Daisy UI is used as a tool to beautify the appearance of this website. I use Daisy Ui because it's very easy to understand, simple, and easy to customize.

7. axios
   Axios is used to simplify the process of using methods to call the API so that the implemented code is simpler.

8. eslint
   Eslint is used as a linter in the code, to make it neater and more structured by adding certain rules.

9. react icons
   React icons is used as a provider of icons used for applications. I use this because it is very easy to access and customize.

10. formik
    Formic is used to handle a form. I use formic because it's very simple to use, and doesn't require long code.

11. react toastify
    React toastify is used to display more elegant and neat alerts. I use it because the integration is very easy, and the customization is simple.

12. redux persist
    Redux persist is used to make it easier to add data to local storage only with redux, and there is no need to use the set item / get item method for data in local storage.

13. redux thunk
    Redux thunk is used to handle API calls that use asynchronous methods.
