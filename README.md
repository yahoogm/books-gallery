# Books Gallery

# About The Project

This website-based book gallery application was built to make it easier for people who like to read to more easily access books, because the system is online, where we don't have to go to a bookstore. You can read books directly in the application because the <a href="https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started" target="blank">Google Books API</a> provides an embedded viewer feature, but not all books can be read directly, for the reason I don't know for sure but the sentence is explained in the following Google Book API documentation.

5.  Javascript </br>
    Javascript is used as the programming language for this application.

6.  daisy UI </br>
    Daisy UI is used as a tool to beautify the appearance of this website. I use Daisy Ui because it's very easy to understand, simple, and easy to customize.

7.  axios </br>
    Axios is used to simplify the process of using methods to call the API so that the implemented code is simpler.

8.  eslint </br>
    Eslint is used as a linter in the code, to make it neater and more structured by adding certain rules.

9.  react icons </br>
    React icons is used as a provider of icons used for applications. I use this because it is very easy to access and customize.

10. formik </br>
    Formic is used to handle a form. I use formic because it's very simple to use, and doesn't require long code.

11. react toastify </br>
    React toastify is used to display more elegant and neat alerts. I use it because the integration is very easy, and the customization is simple.

12. redux persist </br>
    Redux persist is used to make it easier to add data to local storage only with redux, and there is no need to use the set item / get item method for data in local storage.

13. redux thunk </br>
    Redux thunk is used to handle API calls that use asynchronous methods.
